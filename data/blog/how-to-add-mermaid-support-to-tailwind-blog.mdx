To write my blog I'm using [Tailwind NextJS Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).
It's pretty easy, basically you write in **markdown** or in **mdx** and everything just _works_.

Althought [Tailwind NextJS Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) is really **AWESOME**,
does not cover everything that is in my mind nor my whims. And one of my whims is to use [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/)
to make diagrams. I use it every day, it's perfect to document processes, and as is **text**, can be versioned
in Git, so fits perfectly for me.

These are the steps I did to add support for [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) in [Tailwind NextJS Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)

## Install Mermaid

That's the easiest part, just run:

```shell
npm install --save mermaid
```

## Create a component to render Mermaid

This is the _complex_ part. Just create a new file `/components/Mermaid.js` and paste the following code

```typescript
import React from 'react'
import mermaid from 'mermaid'

mermaid.initialize({
  startOnLoad: true,
  theme: 'default',
})

export default class Mermaid extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    mermaid.contentLoaded()
  }
  render() {
    return <div className="mermaid">{this.props.chart}</div>
  }
}
```

Mermaid process everything that it's under a CSS class `mermaid`, so basically this component just
initialize mermaid and creates a div with a CSS class `mermaid`, in which the mermaid syntax will be finally placed.

## Allow MDX to use the new Mermaid component

Before using the component directly, we must configure the MDX Component to allow it. That's pretty simple
too, just open `components/MDXComponents.js` and add the new **Mermaid** component to the `MDXComponents` array:

```typescript
...
import Mermaid from './Mermaid'
...

export const MDXComponents = {
  Mermaid,
  Image,
  TOCInline,
  a: CustomLink,
  ...
}
```

## How to use it

Now you should be able to render Mermaid charts in your MDX! It's as easy as this:

```typescript
<Mermaid
  chart={`
    flowchart LR
      UserService --> |depends on|OrganizationService
      OrganizationService --> |depends on|UserService
  `}
/>
```

That code will render this

<Mermaid
  chart={`
    flowchart LR
      UserService --> |depends on|OrganizationService
      OrganizationService --> |depends on|UserService
  `}
/>

You can create really complex charts with Mermaid, like [this](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-with-mermaid-ex9f7?file=/src/example.js:17-979):

<Mermaid
  chart={`
classDiagram
  class GeoPointType {
  <<enumeration>>
    BROWNFIELD
    OGWELL
    CELL_TOWER
    NUCLEAR_REACTOR
    SUPERFUND
  }
  class GeoPoint {
    -UUID id
    +GeoPointType type
    +GeographyPoint location
    -UUID metadata references metadata(id)
    +Datetime createdAt
  }
  class GeographyPoint {
    <<interface>>
    +GeoJSON geojson
    +Int srid
    +Float longitude
    +Float latitude
  }
  class NearbyPoint {
  <<Interface>>
    -UUID id references GeoPoint(id)
    +GeoPointType GeoPoint::type
    +GeographyPoint GeoPoint::location
    +UUID GeoPoint::metadata
    +Float distance
  }
  class NearbyPoints {
  <<Service>>
    +GeoJSON origin
    +Float radiusMi
    +Int first
    +Int last
    +Int offset
    +Cursor before
    +Cursor after
  }
  class Hotel {
  -UUID id
  +String name
  -Int objectid 
  }
  GeoPoint *-- GeoPointType: Composition
  GeoPoint *-- GeographyPoint: Composition
  GeoPoint "1" <|-- "1" NearbyPoint: Implements
  NearbyPoints "1" -- "0..n"NearbyPoint: Contains
  Hotel "1" -- "1" GeoPoint: May Contain
`}
></Mermaid>

Which corresponds to the following code:

```typescript
<Mermaid
  chart={`
classDiagram
  class GeoPointType {
  <<enumeration>>
    BROWNFIELD
    OGWELL
    CELL_TOWER
    NUCLEAR_REACTOR
    SUPERFUND
  }
  class GeoPoint {
    -UUID id
    +GeoPointType type
    +GeographyPoint location
    -UUID metadata references metadata(id)
    +Datetime createdAt
  }
  class GeographyPoint {
    <<interface>>
    +GeoJSON geojson
    +Int srid
    +Float longitude
    +Float latitude
  }
  class NearbyPoint {
  <<Interface>>
    -UUID id references GeoPoint(id)
    +GeoPointType GeoPoint::type
    +GeographyPoint GeoPoint::location
    +UUID GeoPoint::metadata
    +Float distance
  }
  class NearbyPoints {
  <<Service>>
    +GeoJSON origin
    +Float radiusMi
    +Int first
    +Int last
    +Int offset
    +Cursor before
    +Cursor after
  }
  class Hotel {
  -UUID id
  +String name
  -Int objectid 
  }
  GeoPoint *-- GeoPointType: Composition
  GeoPoint *-- GeographyPoint: Composition
  GeoPoint "1" <|-- "1" NearbyPoint: Implements
  NearbyPoints "1" -- "0..n"NearbyPoint: Contains
  Hotel "1" -- "1" GeoPoint: May Contain
`}
></Mermaid>
```

Cheers!!
