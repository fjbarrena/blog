Can we use NextJS as a Single Page Application? That's what I learned...

# Server Side Rendering (SSR)?

Let's see it with a simple use case.

Figure out that we have a simple page at /pages/[organization]/index.tsx with this simple content

```typescript
const Index = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { organization } = (router as any).query

  return <div>{organization}</div>
}
```

If we execute npm run dev and open the browser at http://localhost:3000/lightside, this is what we will see

It's working... or not? Well, it's working, but this is **because the npm run dev command raises up a NodeJS server
under the hood**, and all works as expected.

Let's try then to build the app for production and then serve it with a simple nginx, or a similar technology
(reverse proxy or static server content). For that we can execute a npm run build-prod, and if all goes well,
we will have the compiled site ready for production in the out directory

```shell
$ npm run build prod
...
Export successful. Files written to xyz
```

We can use the utility serve, which, using their own words:

> Assuming you would like to serve a static site, single page application or just a static file (no matter if on your device or on the local network), this package is just the right choice for you.

Then, we can go to the out directory and just execute the serve command, and this is what you will see

```shell
$ serve
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                                   │
   │   Serving!                                        │
   │                                                   │
   │   - Local:            http://localhost:3000       │
   │   - On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.136:3000   │
   │                                                   │
   │   Copied local address to clipboard!              │
   │                                                   │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

So, if we the open the browser at http://localhost:3000/lightside, we should see the same as the npm run dev
command, but we see this:

WHY???? **Because we don't have a server behind**, we are just serving content, and NextJS don't know what the
hell is lightside.

<h1>Road to Static Server Content</h1>

Reading carefully the NextJS documentation, we just realized that we are not coding to be static server compilant.
For that we need to implement two functions:

- getStaticPaths()
  - Called at build time
  - Returns all the routes that page could have
  - If we are using a dynamic route, like [organization], we must return all the possible values that route can take
    - In our case, we should return here all the possible organizations
- getStaticProps(params: any)
  - Called at build time
  - This function is used to, using the data returned by getStaticPaths(), retrieve all the data that is going to be rendered at the page
    - For example, if we return a list of organization id's in getStaticPaths, we can query to an API to retrieve the data of that organization

This, by nature, **can't be used in dynamic applications that allows users to create content at will**. Think
about it, every time a new user creates a new report at Kyso, we must **rebuild the entire application and deploy
it to production** to allow the user to see the change.

<h1>What about a Single Page Application?</h1>

Officially, NextJS only supports two of these paradigms Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Content Rendering
(SCR). That means, **NextJS don't support Single Page Applications (SPA)**.

Is possible to use NextJS as an SPA but it's officially unsupported

[This post explains pretty well the odyssey to convert NextJS to a SPA](https://colinhacks.com/essays/building-a-spa-with-nextjs)

In summary, is hacky and put at risk future migrations, so I think we must not do it.

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

- NextJS should not be used an as SPA, because is not officially supported, is hacky and put at risk the future upgrades
- For an application as Kyso, which has an API behind and dynamic routes, a Static Content Rendering is not suitable as well, becase we can't anticipate at build time the data we are going to serve
- Then, only the Server Side Rendering is suitable for us
- OR, we can change the underlying technology which supports SPA, like Angular, Vue or Vanilla React.
