Recently, I had a very nice conversation in which the other party asked me **can you describe a previous
experience refactoring a legacy project into a new architecture?**. That's a very deep question, and I
think could be a good exercise to reflect about it, and figure
out how that process can be improved, just in case I face the same problem again in the future.

First of all, let me describe the problem we want to solve.

# The problem

We have a software project. That project is a **monolith**, but it's already decoupled backend-frontend,
doesn't matter in fact in which technologies is built. So basically we have an **API** a **frontend** and a **database**.

      FRONT <--> API
      API <--> DATABASE
  `}
/>

The software is **working for around 20 years**, paying bills, being **profitable**. That piece of software can be
used as a **SaaS**, or **On-Premises**, installed in the customer's infrastructure.

![But it runs](/static/memes/but_it_runs.jpg)

Even paying bills, the software is starting to have several problems related to:

- The **technologies used are pretty old**, and they are starting to don't receive technical **support nor updates**
- As the software didn't evolve progressively over time, it's barely impossible to update their dependencies
  in a secure way
- As the software can be installed On-Premises, **the deployment/installation must be easy for customers**, as several
  times the person who is installing the software is not technical
- **Only works on Windows**, and the company is paying lots of money for licenses that, in fact, are not strictly
  needed because it's a webapp.
- As is a monolith, and was created without having scalability in mind, the software is having issues in
  SaaS version. This is **preventing the company to scale up in customers** with confidence.

# The strategy

Having into account the previous data, this is the strategy I would follow:

- **The architecture can't be complex**, because **a complex architecture is a complex deployment**. If we want to
  deploy 40 microservices, 6 databases and 2 event brokers in at least 3 zones of AWS for High Availability,
  that's great, but that's complex too. Let's keep the architecture as simple as possible.
- **Use the same technology stack**, if possible, but in the latest **LTS versions**, so we can reuse pieces
  of code from the older implementation, and the transition to the new architecture would be easier.
- **Dockerize everything**, to standardize how it's deployed, and to give us the ability to deploy it in
  an orchestrator in SaaS to scale-up when necessary. Also, we will be able to run the project in **any operating system**
- **Extract the model to a separate dependency**, so you can reuse it in different parts of the architecture. Ideally,
  the frontend can share it too. If that's not the case, because the backend is in C# and the frontend is in Typescript,
  then you will need to maintain two models (one in C#, and another one in Typescript). To have a shared model
  between the components in the architecture **is key to ensure the consistency of the data and the changes**.

# The process

## 1. Analyze the current architecture and figure out which components can be splitted

Remember, we don't want to increase the complexity of the architecture if it's not necessary. Having that in
mind, if our software is working for 20 years we should have an idea about which parts of the software requires
more care, and which parts of the software are preventing us to scale up properly. Figuring out which parts deserve
to have their own entity (a docker image, let's say) in the architecture is a good exercise, that can condition
future decisions.

Try to **don't apply premature optimizations**, remember what [Donald Knuth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74RdET79q40) said

> Premature optimization is the root of all evil

In my opinion, **it's better to invest time modularizing your application well, preparing it to be easily decoupled, instead
of directly decoupling it**, because probably you will be decoupling the wrong parts. **Decouple it based on your needs and the
evidence (data), not based in the boxes drawn in a paper**.

## 2. Start small

Once you have a clear vision about how your architecture would look, then it's time to start working on it.
I suggest you to start with a small use case, if it's possible, something that is not widely used in your application.

For example, let's say that the application has a set of endpoints related to **comments**, but it's a feature that the
users are not using it so much. That's perfect, if we make a mistake refactoring it, the users probably will not notice it.

Working on it, you will learn different lessons that you would apply later in the most important parts of the software, reducing
the impact of the customers.

## 3. Be iterative and incremental

Imagine you want to refactor 50 endpoints. As we said previously, you will start with something small, but... when you are
going to deploy the new changes into production?

I suggest you to do it as soon as possible, and don't wait to have everything refactored to make a totally new installation.
For example, if I started refactoring 3 endpoints related to comments functionality, I would like to deploy these 3 new
endpoints fast. So in my SaaS version, I can prepare something like this:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
    flowchart TD
      FRONT --> REVERSE_PROXY
      REVERSE_PROXY -->|the rest of the endpoints, except comments| OLD_API
      REVERSE_PROXY -->|comments| NEW_API
      OLD_API --> id1[(Database)] 
      NEW_API --> id1 
  `}
/>

Iteratively and incrementally, more endpoints will be available in the new API, and less will remain
in the old API. This will give you as well a quick **rollback strategy** if something goes wrong, just
configuring properly the reverse proxy you can come back to the old implementation if it's needed.

## 4. Maintain the API contract as much as possible

The API contract, which describes how an API works, must be protected. If in your new, glorious API, everything is
different than in the old API, you will need to put tons of effort in the frontend as well, because the old
calls will not work anymore. **If the previous API has a good API design, I suggest you to continue following it**.

I know, sometimes the APIs we want to change are because their API contracts are a mess... in that case, you don't have
a choice... but if that's not the case, try to don't change irrelevant details just because you think are prettier or fancier.
For example, if the API is in snake_case, and you prefer a lowerCamelCase because if more readable in your opinion, just let the
snake_case... you will be grateful with yourself in the near future!

## 5. The two way tests

Don't deliver a thing without tests. Remember, you are refactoring something that it's working, so it's not acceptable
to deliver a new fancy thing that just don't works. Take advantage of the opportunity and ask to yourself, and involve your team as well,
in a "how-this-must-work" process.

For example, I love to involve QA teams in this, and prepare a test suite to test the new endpoints.
Why the QA team? because they are much more exhaustive in their tests than a developer. For example, me as a developer,
if I want to test the endpoint `DELETE /comment/{id}`, I would test:

- If I try to delete a comment that doesn't exists
- If I try to delete a comment that exists but I don't have enough permissions to do it so
- If I try to delete a comment that exists and I have enough permissions
- And probably some combinations of these

This is the test suite prepared by a QA (Elena Rueda - Kyso) for the same endpoint

![Yes meme](/static/memes/yes-leñador.gif)

The best developer in the world would have come up with at most 10 use cases for this endpoint, but Elena (QA Lead) found 27 of them.
Really impressive.

Please note that:

- These tests definitions are done in Gherkin in a "top-language-level" that it's understandable for everyone
- There are test data, so make sure you prepare a way to populate your test environment with the required data
- If the specs are well done, the code that satifies the tests is pretty simple
- Make sure you don't let developers to merge into production branch (at least) if the test are failing
  or missing.
- Sounds simple, but preparing a good testing environment requires time, don't understimate it.

We can go deeper and deeper on the topic, because it's exciting, but these are my 5 more important things I
wanted to highlight. What do you think? Did you miss something on the article? I would love to hear from you
