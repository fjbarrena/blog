Francisco is a **software architect** and **software developer** specialized in scalable systems based on decoupled architectures, microservices (if there is a reason to use them :D) and cloud environments.

He has a wide experience leading and managing heterogeneous technical teams (developers, devops, security, machine learning and data analyst), for example as **Head of engineering** and **Head of cybersecurity research group** at ITI, and as **CTO** at Kyso. But even in management roles, Francisco is a **hands-on** person that likes to build things.

Francisco is proactive in learning new technologies and paradigms, with a strong interest in developing software products with quality and security, in the code and in the infrastructure.

Finally, he is a frequent speaker in technical events, and a former professor at the **Politechnic University of Valencia**, in the **Big Data Analytics Master**, and in the **University of Mondrag√≥n**, teaching **Cloud Security** in the Specialist Course of National Security Scheme.
